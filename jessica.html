		One of my favorite games from childhood was Crazy Taxi because it brings back a lot of good memories. In middle school,
		me and my friends would all play this after school and compete with one another to have the highest score.

	<p id="about">
		In Crazy Taxi, you're a taxi driver and you have to make it to your stop in time but there are other car obstacles
		in the way. You can steer around them or jump over them.
